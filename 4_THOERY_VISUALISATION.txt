AIM:
To perform various types of data visualization operations using Tableau on the Adult and Iris datasets to understand different visualization dimensions and their analytical insights.

OBJECTIVE:

1. To explore and visualize datasets using different visualization techniques in Tableau.
2. To understand the concepts of 1D, 2D, 3D, temporal, multidimensional, tree, and network visualizations.
3. To identify patterns, trends, and relationships within the Adult and Iris datasets through visual representation.
4. To demonstrate how Tableau can be used for effective data exploration and decision-making.

THEORY:

1. 1D (Linear) Data Visualization:
   This visualization represents data using a single variable. It helps analyze the distribution or frequency of one attribute. Common examples include bar charts, histograms, and line charts.
   In Tableau, it can be used to visualize one attribute like “Age” or “Petal Length” from the Iris dataset.

2. 2D (Planar) Data Visualization:
   This type of visualization shows the relationship between two variables using a 2D plane. Examples include scatter plots and bubble charts.
   For example, plotting “Petal Length” vs. “Petal Width” in the Iris dataset helps visualize species separation.

3. 3D (Volumetric) Data Visualization:
   3D visualization represents data across three variables, allowing users to observe interactions among multiple dimensions.
   In Tableau, 3D scatter plots can display “Sepal Length,” “Sepal Width,” and “Petal Length” together for the Iris dataset to understand complex relationships.

4. Temporal Data Visualization:
   This visualization shows how data changes over time. Common examples are line charts, area charts, and time-series plots.
   In Tableau, time-based attributes like “Year” or “Age Group” can be plotted to track changes in trends or frequencies over a timeline.

5. Multidimensional Data Visualization:
   This involves visualizing data with more than three attributes. Techniques such as heat maps, parallel coordinate plots, and small multiples are used.
   In Tableau, dimensions like “Education,” “Occupation,” and “Income” from the Adult dataset can be combined to analyze multi-attribute relationships.

6. Tree / Hierarchical Data Visualization:
   This type of visualization displays hierarchical relationships between data elements using tree maps or dendrograms.
   In Tableau, tree maps can represent categories and subcategories, such as “Occupation → Education Level” from the Adult dataset.

7. Network Data Visualization:
   Network visualization shows relationships between connected entities, represented by nodes and links.
   In Tableau, such data can be imported and visualized to represent social connections, communication networks, or organizational structures.

CONCLUSION:
The visualization techniques performed using Tableau on the Adult and Iris datasets provide insights into data distribution, relationships, and patterns. Each visualization type serves a unique purpose — from simple 1D analysis to complex multidimensional or network representations — demonstrating the power of Tableau in data exploration and visual analytics.
